                In today's constantly changing business and tech requirements,
                adaptability is the key for survival. Technology companies needs
                a team which can be adaptable and resilient to sudden changes in
                project tech stack. We find it critically important and we have
                unique way of figuring out this ability. Irrespective of what
                tech stack candidate belongs, we evaluate candidates true
                engineering skill by giving them problems which is not related
                to their current tech stack. Candidate is free to use internet
                and solve the task in a given time frame. This shows true
                engineering skills and it proves candidate can deal whatever
                challenges you throw at him. This will be clearly evident in the
                candidate profile we share with you for your final judgements.
