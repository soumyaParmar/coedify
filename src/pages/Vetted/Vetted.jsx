                Assessing soft skills is even harder and we do not believing in
                asking question to test this, we believe in practical
                evaluation. By soft skills, we particularly checking
                collaboration and communication. We usually test this by
                assigning a technical task to group of developers with mixed
                experience to solve and come out with an execution plan. We
                evaluate everyone contribution and asses the results.

                challenges with ease.
